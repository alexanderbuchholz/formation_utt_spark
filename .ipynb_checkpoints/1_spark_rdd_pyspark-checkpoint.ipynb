    "# Apache Spark data representations: RDD / Dataframe / Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark has three data representations: RDD, Dataframe, Dataset. For each data representation, Spark has a different API. For example, later we are going to use ml (a library), which currently supports only Dataframe API. Dataframe is much faster than RDD because it has metadata (some information about data) associated with it, which allows Spark to optimize the query plan. The Dataframe feature in Apache Spark was added in Spark 1.3. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will spend some time on RDD, to get you started with Apache Spark. Later, we will spend some time on Dataframes. Dataframes share some common characteristics with RDD (transformations and actions). We arenot going to talk about Dataset as this functionality is not included in PySpark.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RDD:\n",
    "After installing and configuring PySpark, we can start programming using Spark in Python. But to use Spark functionality, we must use RDDs. A RDD (Resilient Distributed Database) is a collection of elements, that can be divided across multiple nodes in a cluster to run parallel processing. It is also fault tolerant collection of elements, which means it can automatically recover from failures. RDD is immutable, we can create a RDD once but can’t change it. We can apply any number of operation on it and can create another RDD by applying some transformations. Here are a few things to keep in mind about RDD:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply 2 types of operations on RDDs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Transformation: Transformation refers to the operation applied on a RDD to create a new RDD.\n",
    "* Action: Actions refer to an operation which also apply on RDD that perform computation and send the result back to driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Map (Transformation) performs operation on each element of RDD and returns a new RDD. But, in case of Reduce (Action), it reduces / aggregates the output of a map by applying some functions (Reduce by key). There are many transformations and actions that are defined in Apache Spark documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDDs use Shared Variables:\n",
    "The parallel operations in Apache Spark use shared variable. It means that whenever a task is sent by a driver to executors program in a cluster, a copy of shared variable is sent to each node in a cluster, so that they can use this variable while performing tasks. Accumulator and Broadcast are the two types of shared variables supported by Apache Spark.\n",
    "Broadcast: We can use the Broadcast variable to save the copy of data across all node.\n",
    "Accumulator: In Accumulator variables are used for aggregating the information.\n",

    "\n",
    "First step in any Apache programming is to create a SparkContext. SparkContext is needed when we want to execute operations in a cluster. SparkContext tells Spark how and where to access a cluster. It is first step to connect with Apache Cluster. If you are using Spark Shell, we will find that this is already created.
