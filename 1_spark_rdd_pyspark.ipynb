    "# Apache Spark data representations: RDD / Dataframe / Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark has three data representations: RDD, Dataframe, Dataset. For each data representation, Spark has a different API. For example, later we are going to use ml (a library), which currently supports only Dataframe API. Dataframe is much faster than RDD because it has metadata (some information about data) associated with it, which allows Spark to optimize the query plan. The Dataframe feature in Apache Spark was added in Spark 1.3. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will spend some time on RDD, to get you started with Apache Spark. Later, we will spend some time on Dataframes. Dataframes share some common characteristics with RDD (transformations and actions). We arenot going to talk about Dataset as this functionality is not included in PySpark.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RDD:\n",
    "After installing and configuring PySpark, we can start programming using Spark in Python. But to use Spark functionality, we must use RDDs. A RDD (Resilient Distributed Database) is a collection of elements, that can be divided across multiple nodes in a cluster to run parallel processing. It is also fault tolerant collection of elements, which means it can automatically recover from failures. RDD is immutable, we can create a RDD once but can’t change it. We can apply any number of operation on it and can create another RDD by applying some transformations. Here are a few things to keep in mind about RDD:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply 2 types of operations on RDDs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Transformation: Transformation refers to the operation applied on a RDD to create a new RDD.\n",
    "* Action: Actions refer to an operation which also apply on RDD that perform computation and send the result back to driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Map (Transformation) performs operation on each element of RDD and returns a new RDD. But, in case of Reduce (Action), it reduces / aggregates the output of a map by applying some functions (Reduce by key). There are many transformations and actions that are defined in Apache Spark documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDDs use Shared Variables:\n",
    "The parallel operations in Apache Spark use shared variable. It means that whenever a task is sent by a driver to executors program in a cluster, a copy of shared variable is sent to each node in a cluster, so that they can use this variable while performing tasks. Accumulator and Broadcast are the two types of shared variables supported by Apache Spark.\n",
    "Broadcast: We can use the Broadcast variable to save the copy of data across all node.\n",
    "Accumulator: In Accumulator variables are used for aggregating the information.\n",

    "How to Create a RDD in Apache Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing storage: When we want to create a RDD though existing storage in driver program (which we would like to be parallelized). For example, converting a list to RDD, which is already created in a driver program.\n",
    "\n",
    "External sources: When we want to create a RDD though external sources such as a shared file system, HDFS, HBase, or any data source offering a Hadoop Input Format.\n",

    "Writing a first program in Apache Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already discussed that RDD supports two type of operations, which are transformation and action. Let us get down to writing our first program:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Create SparkContext\n",
    "\n",
    "First step in any Apache programming is to create a SparkContext. SparkContext is needed when we want to execute operations in a cluster. SparkContext tells Spark how and where to access a cluster. It is first step to connect with Apache Cluster. If you are using Spark Shell, we will find that this is already created. Otherwise, we can create the Spark Context by importing, initializing and providing the configuration settings. For example:"

    "## Step 2: Create a RDD\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create RDD in two ways: Either from an existing storage or from an external storage. Let’s create our first RDD. SparkContext has the parallelize method, which is used for creating the Spark RDD from an iterable (like list, tuple..) already present in driver program.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also provide the number of partitions as a parameter to parallelize method. If we do not give number of partition parameter, then Spark will automatically set the number of partition in a cluster. The number of partition can be set manually by passing a second parameter to the parallelize method. For example, sc.parallelize(data, 10)), where data is an existing data in driver program and 10 is the number of partitions.\n",
